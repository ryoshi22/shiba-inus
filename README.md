Build a new kind of Decentralized In a world where time tends to be seen as a commodity, community-centered projects are more than just a change of pace, they are an attempt to radically accept one another. When success hangs on the relative strength of each individual, we sometimes tend to shift our focus in alignment with those around us. Shiba Inus is one such approach in recognizing the other side of tearing down a long-established paradigm of a formulaic success and building a path to freedom and creativity in its place.
The world's only token project that is run by majority of its community
We are an exercise in decentralized spontaneous community building
Projects centered around the community are generally untamed. As we move further away from the usual status quo and traditional mindsets, we tend to discover various approaches to problems and ways to effectively relate to one another.
A community is usually composed of hundreds, if not thousands, of interconnected individuals. By considering those drawn to our project, we realized that true power relies not from one vantage point, it comes harmonically from tying things up.Ryujin   -   Founder/Shiba Inus
